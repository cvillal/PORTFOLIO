//Created HTML template to get organized by sections
    -once I started testing stuff out I had to do it through CSS and its hard to get things situated and to move accordingly
    -having a hard time not getting carried away with CSS bc everything seems to go back to it
    -managed to get a dropdown buttom/menu based on wome W3 examples but I have not been able to customize it
    -having a hard time with alignment/inline-block/float etc to get the elements to where I need them
